# Accessing Elements of Lists

# Two types of numbers: Ordinal and cardinal

# The numbers that we use daily are ordinal numbers. Like 1st, 2nd.
# We call these kinds of numbers "ordinal" numbers, because they
# indicate an ordering of things.

# Programmers use cardinal numbers.. Like element at 0.
# To programmers, the list of animals is more like a deck of cards. If
# they want the tiger, they grab it. If they want the zebra, they can take it too.
# Remember: ordinal == ordered, 1st; cardinal == cards at random, 0.

animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

### For each of these, write out a full sentence of the form: "The first (1st)
### animal is at 0 and is a bear." Then say it backwards: "The animal at 0 is
### the 1st animal and is a bear."
